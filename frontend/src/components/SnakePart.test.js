Your test setup for the GameBoard component has a slight mistake. The `getAllByRole` function from React Testing Library is used for selecting HTML elements by their accessibility roles, not their CSS classes. In this case, we should use `getByTestId` or `queryAllByTestId` functions instead.

Here's the corrected test setup:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import GameBoard from './GameBoard';

test('renders the game board with a snake and food', () => {
  const snake = { parts: [{ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 120, y: 100 }] };
  const food = { x: 200, y: 200 };

  const { queryAllByTestId } = render(<GameBoard snake={snake} food={food} />);

  const snakeParts = queryAllByTestId('snake-part');
  expect(snakeParts).toHaveLength(2);

  const foodItem = queryAllByTestId('food');
  expect(foodItem).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

But for this to work, you'll have to add `data-testid` attributes to your components:

```jsx
const SnakePart = ({ part }) => (
  <div data-testid="snake-part" className="snake-part" style={{ left: `${part.x}px`, top: `${part.y}px` }}></div>
);

const Food = ({ food }) => (
  <div data-testid="food" className="food" style={{ left: `${food.x}px`, top: `${food.y}px` }}></div>
);
```

Please note that `data-testid` should be used as a last resort when you cannot select by role or label or text. In a real project, you would want to add proper roles to your components and select by those in your tests.
