Based on the previous example, we can write a similar unit test setup for the GameOver component using Jest and React Testing Library:

First, install the necessary libraries if you haven't done it yet:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

And here is the test:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import GameOver from './GameOver';

describe('<GameOver />', () => {
    it('renders without crashing', () => {
        render(<GameOver gameOver={true} onPlayAgain={() => {}} />);
    });

    it('does not render anything if game is not over', () => {
        const { container } = render(<GameOver gameOver={false} onPlayAgain={() => {}} />);
        expect(container.firstChild).toBeNull();
    });

    it('renders game over message and play again button if game is over', () => {
        const { getByText } = render(<GameOver gameOver={true} onPlayAgain={() => {}} />);
        expect(getByText('Game Over')).toBeInTheDocument();
        expect(getByText('Play Again')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    it('calls onPlayAgain when play again button is clicked', () => {
        const onPlayAgain = jest.fn();
        const { getByText } = render(<GameOver gameOver={true} onPlayAgain={onPlayAgain} />);
        fireEvent.click(getByText('Play Again'));
        expect(onPlayAgain).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    });
});
```

This test suite checks the basic functionality of the GameOver component, including the "Play Again" button click event. React Testing Library aims to test the component in a way that is similar to how a user would, which can make the tests more robust and less prone to implementation details.
