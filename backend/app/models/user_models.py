The given API code already includes Pydantic models for the User and Settings endpoints. These models are used for both request and response validation.

The User model is defined as follows:

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str
    password: str
    is_admin: bool
```

The User model has four fields: username, email, password, and is_admin. All fields are required (since none are marked as Optional). The is_admin field is a boolean that indicates whether or not the user is an administrator.

The Settings model is defined as follows:

```python
class Settings(BaseModel):
    setting_id: str
    value: str
```

The Settings model has two fields: setting_id and value. Both fields are required.

These models are used as request bodies in the POST and PUT endpoints for users and settings. They are also used as response models for these endpoints. This means that FastAPI will automatically validate the request data against these models and will also use these models to format the response data.

For example, in the create_user endpoint:

```python
@app.post("/user/", response_model=User)
def create_user(user: User):
    ...
```

The function parameter user: User tells FastAPI to expect a request body in the format of the User model. FastAPI will automatically validate the request data and will raise an error if the data is not valid. The response_model=User argument tells FastAPI to format the response data according to the User model.

The same principles apply to the other endpoints and the Settings model. 

In a real-world application, you may also want to use Pydantic models to define data transfer objects (DTOs) for transferring data between different parts of your application. However, this is not necessary in this simple example.
