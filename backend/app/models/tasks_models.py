The given API endpoint does not require a specific request model since the only parameters it takes in are `skip` and `limit`, which are simple integers, not complex data structures. These parameters are often used in pagination of results.

The response model is already included in the given code as the `Task` Pydantic model. When a list of tasks is returned from the endpoint, FastAPI will automatically validate the response data and serialize it into a JSON response, with each task in the list represented as an instance of the `Task` model.

Here's how the `Task` model looks:

```python
class Task(TaskBase):
    id: int

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

This model extends `TaskBase` and adds an `id` field. The `Config` class with `orm_mode = True` is a Pydantic configuration that allows the model to read data from SQLAlchemy models.

The `TaskBase` model is defined as:

```python
class TaskBase(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., example="Buy groceries")
    description: str = Field(..., example="Buy milk and bread from the supermarket")
```

This model includes `title` and `description` fields. The `Field` function is used to add extra information to the field, like an example value that will be used in the OpenAPI documentation.

As for data transfer objects, the `DBTask` class is used to represent tasks in the database:

```python
class DBTask:
    def __init__(self, id: int, title: str, description: str):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
```

In a real-world application, this would be replaced with an actual SQLAlchemy model.
